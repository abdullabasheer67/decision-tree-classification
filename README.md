# 🌳 Decision Tree Classification – Machine Learning Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Decision Tree Classifier** using **scikit-learn**.  
The notebook was developed in **Google Colab** and focuses on understanding the core working of decision trees.

---

## 📌 Project Objective
To build and evaluate a decision tree model for classification and gain hands-on experience with:
- Data preprocessing
- Model training
- Performance evaluation
- Tree visualization

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- Decision Tree fundamentals
- Gini Index & Entropy
- Train–Test Split
- Model Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Overfitting in Decision Trees

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Google Colab**

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

---

## 🔄 Workflow
1. Import required libraries  
2. Load dataset  
3. Split data into training and testing sets  
4. Train Decision Tree Classifier  
5. Evaluate using accuracy score and confusion matrix  
6. Visualize the decision tree  

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using:
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix

These metrics help understand how well the classifier predicts unseen data.
